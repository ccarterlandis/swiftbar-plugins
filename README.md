# Swiftbar Plugins

This repo currently contains my only plugin, `old-docker-containers`. Every 5 minutes, it will set the menu bar item to notify me if I have Docker containers running or not, and if so, if there are any that have been running for longer than 8 hours.

## Config
- Plugins are stored in `$HOME/.config/swiftbar/`
- Create a regular symlink for whatever plugin in this directory to the config folder

### old-docker-containers

TODO:
- [ ] Add fancy formatting?
- [ ] Use better emoji?
- [ ] Blank when no output
- [ ] Add list of exceptions (is user input allowed?)
